# Sleep-Apnea-Mlp

This repository contains an independent implementation of the method described in the following article.

## Reference (Method)

Kohzadi, Zeinab, Reza Safdari, and Khosro Sadeghniiat Haghighi. (2020). Determination of sleep apnea severity using multi-layer perceptron neural network. *Sleep Medicine Research*, 11(2), 70-76.

## Data Source

The data used for this implementation is from the following Kaggle dataset:  
**"Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset"**  
Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset

**Note:**  
The dataset consists of 400 rows and 13 columns, including variables such as gender, age, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity, stress level, BMI category, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and the presence or absence of sleep disorders (None, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea).

*The author of the dataset states that the data is synthetic and generated for illustrative purposes.*

## Additional Components

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  
This project includes a custom-developed graphical user interface (GUI) implemented in C# for model demonstration and user interaction.  
**Note:** The original article did not provide any GUI implementation; this component was independently designed and developed as part of this project.
